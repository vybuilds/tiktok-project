## Project Overview

This project develops a predictive machine learning model for TikTok to automatically classify video content as either containing **claims** (statements that can be verified as true or false) or **opinions** (subjective viewpoints that cannot be objectively verified).

### Project Background
TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

## Problem Statement

**Business Goal**: Reduce the backlog of user reports and improve the efficiency of content moderation by automatically classifying videos as claims vs. opinions.

**Technical Goal**: Build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a TikTok video contains:
- **Claim**: A statement that can be verified as true or false
- **Opinion**: A subjective viewpoint that cannot be objectively verified

## Dataset

The dataset contains TikTok video metadata and engagement metrics including:
- Video transcription text
- Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, comments)
- User verification status
- Video duration
- Author information
- Target variable: `claim_status` (claim/opinion)

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Data Loading**: Load and inspect the TikTok dataset
2. **EDA**: Explore engagement patterns and content characteristics
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean data and engineer features
4. **Modeling**: Train and compare multiple algorithms
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and interpretability

##  Model Performance 

*rounded*
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Logistic Regression | 67% | 63% | 82% | 71% |
| XGBoost | 99% | 100% | 99% | 100% |

**Best Model**: Random forest

### Key Insights
- The most predictive features are:
`video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, `video_share_count`, `video_download_count` which are all related to engagement of the video.
- The random forest model could be overfitting.
